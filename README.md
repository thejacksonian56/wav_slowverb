## How to use it
The current version of SlowVerb can be downloaded in the releases section of this page. Upon opening the program, you can browse for the .wav you want to edit (a copy will be made in the same location as the original and the original will not be modified).

Then, you can select 'Save Changes and Play' and preview the changes you have made. You may continue making changes to the audio as you see fit.
